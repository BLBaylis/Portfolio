      <p class = "bio">Hi, I'm Brad and I'm from Essex in the UK.  I've always been interested in many different topics, especially maths, philosophy and science.
       </p>
      <p class = "bio"> What I didn't realise as a child was this stemmed from a general enjoyment of learning new things and this passion lead me to achieve a bachelor's degree in Mathematics with the Open University, which is a distance learning university. 
      </p> 
      <p class="bio">The same desire to learn has led me down the path of self-taught web-developer!  Some other interests of mine include gaming, running, climbing and cycling.</p>
